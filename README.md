# microbit-flappy-bird-game
Flappy bird game on a micro:bit!

This little program allows you to play the popular game Flappy Bird on your micro:bit,
although not a perfect implementation, it represents the game well enough.

## Game instruction
On game start: Press A to play on easy mode, B to play hard mode. When in game, the bird will be constantly falling down due to gravity, press A or B to jump and dodge the poles. And try not to fall out of the screen because you will die!

Game modes:
- Easy mode: 2 bird-height wide gap between the poles, easier to maneuver around.
- Hard mode: 1 bird-height wide gap between the pole, added a ceiling above the top of the screen, so if you try to jump too high, you will hit your head and die :)
